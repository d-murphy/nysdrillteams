### Data Issues to investigate
* update classes
* use classes when figuring out points? 
* 2011 Joe Hunter is sanctioned and cfp
* 2011 states has no running order
* why do nassau teams have true booleans for suffolk points (2008 three man ladder @ central islip)
    * maybe class can fix this? 
* state record flags are run in runDb
* update name of old id field
* there is a tournament with id: 'hose tester checked on 8/13/93 found it to be illegal by rules committee.'

### To Do

* query db for last old_id and save on class
* collation to sort strings as numbers?
* need a new column in runs - can do this from a query? 
* considering select columns for some requests
* handle cursor for getFilteredRuns
* add cors
* aws to save images
* getSeasons - agg query on tournaments

### Ideas
* index on tournamentId (convert to numeric?)?
* Most points scored in year, circuit, sanctioned
