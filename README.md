### To Do

* add service for sponsers

* add cors
* need to do async in controllers after db
* use an importer, esp on router
* write db module
* way to save images on teams
* edit note endpoint
* edit link endpoint
* edit tournament live stream planned? 
* edit tournament urls?

### Ideas: 
* Most points scored in year, circuit, sanctioned

Conclusions:
* Do not need season service? Just agg query on tournaments for each year
