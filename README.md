# NYS Drill Teams

This project lives at [nysfddt.com](https://nysfddt.com).  Its an archive of results of a drill competition between fire departments across New York State.  Think of it as Baseball Reference for FD Racing.  

It provides a schedule for this year's events, a look at past seasons, a search interface to find the fatest runs and links to YT videos.  An adminstrative interface also exists to save new events.

The frontend is built with React / Bootstrap.  The backend is built with Node / Express and MongoDb.  Its hosted on AWS S3 / Cloudfront and the backend lives on an AWS lightsail instance.
