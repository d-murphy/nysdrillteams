### To Do


* 2011 Joe Hunter is sanctioned and cfp
* 2011 states has no running order
* remove mocks
* why do nassau teams have true booleans for suffolk points (2008 three man ladder @ central islip)
    * maybe class can fix this? 
* consider only return certain colums in all pulls
* confirm types from collections match types file
* add other endpoints

* handle cursor for getFilteredRuns
* considering select columns for some requests
* state record flags are run in runDb
* index on tournamentId (convert to numeric?)?
* test insert / delete / update, once tournaments are available.  

* unsure about teams class and circuit


* add cors
* aws to save images

* edit note endpoint
* edit link endpoint
* edit tournament live stream planned? 
* edit tournament urls?

### Ideas: 
* Most points scored in year, circuit, sanctioned

Conclusions:
* Do not need season service? Just agg query on tournaments for each year
