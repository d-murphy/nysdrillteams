### To Do

* Try to add some db-related functions to loadData
* add rename function to do overwrites
* overwrite runs db with new trackLUT
* do tournaments

* handle cursor for getFilteredRuns
* considering select columns for some requests
* state record flags are run in runDb
* index on tournamentId?
* test insert / delete / update, once tournaments are available.  

* unsure about teams class and circuit


* add cors
* aws to save images

* edit note endpoint
* edit link endpoint
* edit tournament live stream planned? 
* edit tournament urls?

### Ideas: 
* Most points scored in year, circuit, sanctioned

Conclusions:
* Do not need season service? Just agg query on tournaments for each year
